Limitations and other things which are not (yet) supported:
===========================================================

djgpp2/coff
-----------
 * all overlays (except Allegro pakfiles) are silently stripped

dos/exe
-------
 * normal dos/exes with new exe headers
 * max ~24000 relocation records (...should be enough for everyone ;-)
 * exe + sys combined images

watcom/le
---------
 * 16-bit selector alias fixups
 * 16-bit offset relocation for objects larger than 4 kB
 * 16:16 fixups

If you need any of the above (they're very rare), send us an URL of a
test file.

 * 16-bit objects are not loaded into DOS memory
 * There is still a problem with the wdosx extender: if you compress a
   watcom/le file which does NOT contain the wdosx extender, and after this
   you bind the wdosx stub to the compressed file, then it will work.
   Otherwise it won't.
 * unpacked pmwlite compressed programs might not work when compressed
   with UPX (this is a bug in pmwunlite)

win32/pe
--------
 * writeable shared sections (`--force' *may* work)
 * certificates in the image
 * compressing files which contain a big BSS requires lots of memory
   during compression
