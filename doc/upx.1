no memory overhead or other drawbacks for most of the formats supported,
because of in-place decompression.

.SH "SECURITY CONTEXT"
.IX Header "SECURITY CONTEXT"
\&\s-1IMPORTANT NOTE:\s0 \fB\s-1UPX\s0\fR inherits the security context of any files it handles.
.PP
This means that packing, unpacking, or even testing or listing a file requires
the same security considerations as actually executing the file.
.PP
Use \fB\s-1UPX\s0\fR on trusted files only!
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fB\s-1UPX\s0\fR is a versatile executable packer with the following features:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  \- secure: as UPX is documented Open Source since many years any relevant
\&      Security/Antivirus software is able to peek inside UPX compressed
\&      apps to verify them
\&
\&  \- excellent compression ratio: typically compresses better than Zip,
\&      use UPX to decrease the size of your distribution !
\&
\&  \- very fast decompression: more than 500 MB/sec on any reasonably modern
\&      machine
\&
\&  \- no memory overhead for your compressed executables for most of the
\&      supported formats because of in\-place decompression
\&
\&  \- safe: you can list, test and unpack your executables.
\&      Also, a checksum of both the compressed and uncompressed file is
\&      maintained internally.
\&
\&  \- universal: UPX can pack a number of executable formats, including
\&      Windows programs and DLLs, macOS apps and Linux executables
\&
\&  \- portable: UPX is written in portable endian\-neutral C++
\&
\&  \- extendable: because of the class layout it\*(Aqs very easy to support
\&      new executable formats or add new compression algorithms
\&
\&  \- free: UPX is distributed with full source code under the GNU General
\&      Public License v2+, with special exceptions granting the free usage
\&      for commercial programs
.Ve
.PP
You probably understand now why we call \fB\s-1UPX\s0\fR the "\fIultimate\fR"
executable packer.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.IX Header "COMMANDS"
.SS "Compress"
.IX Subsection "Compress"
This is the default operation, eg. \fBupx yourfile.exe\fR will compress the file
specified on the command line.
.SS "Decompress"
.IX Subsection "Decompress"
All \fB\s-1UPX\s0\fR supported file formats can be unpacked using the \fB\-d\fR switch, eg.
\&\fBupx \-d yourfile.exe\fR will uncompress the file you've just compressed.
.SS "Test"
.IX Subsection "Test"
The \fB\-t\fR command tests the integrity of the compressed and uncompressed
data, eg. \fBupx \-t yourfile.exe\fR check whether your file can be safely
decompressed. Note, that this command doesn't check the whole file, only
the part that will be uncompressed during program execution. This means
that you should not use this command instead of a virus checker.
.SS "List"
.IX Subsection "List"
The \fB\-l\fR command prints out some information about the compressed files
specified on the command line as parameters, eg \fBupx \-l yourfile.exe\fR
shows the compressed / uncompressed size and the compression ratio of
\&\fIyourfile.exe\fR.

.SH "COMPRESSION LEVELS & TUNING"
.IX Header "COMPRESSION LEVELS & TUNING"
\&\fB\s-1UPX\s0\fR offers ten different compression levels from \fB\-1\fR to \fB\-9\fR,
and \fB\-\-best\fR.  The default compression level is \fB\-8\fR for files
smaller than 512 KiB, and \fB\-7\fR otherwise.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Compression levels 1, 2 and 3 are pretty fast.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Compression levels 4, 5 and 6 achieve a good time/ratio performance.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Compression levels 7, 8 and 9 favor compression ratio over speed.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Compression level \fB\-\-best\fR may take a long time.
.PP
Note that compression level \fB\-\-best\fR can be somewhat slow for large
files, but you definitely should use it when releasing a final version
of your program.
.PP
Quick info for achieving the best compression ratio:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Try \fBupx \-\-brute \-\-no\-lzma myfile.exe\fR or even
\&\fBupx \-\-ultra\-brute \-\-no\-lzma myfile.exe\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The option \fB\-\-lzma\fR enables \s-1LZMA\s0 compression, which compresses better but
is *significantly slower* at decompression. You probably do not want
to use it for large files.
.Sp
(Note that \fB\-\-lzma\fR is automatically enabled by \fB\-\-all\-methods\fR and
\&\fB\-\-brute\fR, use \fB\-\-no\-lzma\fR to override.)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Try if \fB\-\-overlay=strip\fR works.
.IP "\(bu" 4
For win32/pe programs there's \fB\-\-strip\-relocs=0\fR. See notes below.
.SH "OVERLAY HANDLING OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OVERLAY HANDLING OPTIONS"
Info: An \*(L"overlay\*(R" means auxiliary data attached after the logical end of
an executable, and it often contains application specific data
(this is a common practice to avoid an extra data file, though
it would be better to use resource sections).
.PP
\&\fB\s-1UPX\s0\fR handles overlays like many other executable packers do: it simply
copies the overlay after the compressed image. This works with some
files, but doesn't work with others, depending on how an application
actually accesses this overlaid data.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  \-\-overlay=copy    Copy any extra data attached to the file. [DEFAULT]
\&
\&  \-\-overlay=strip   Strip any overlay from the program instead of
\&                    copying it. Be warned, this may make the compressed
\&                    program crash or otherwise unusable.
\&
\&  \-\-overlay=skip    Refuse to compress any program which has an overlay.
.Ve
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE"
The environment variable \fB\s-1UPX\s0\fR can hold a set of default
options for \fB\s-1UPX\s0\fR. These options are interpreted first and
can be overwritten by explicit command line parameters.
For example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    for DOS/Windows:   set UPX=\-9 \-\-compress\-icons#0
\&    for sh/ksh/zsh:    UPX="\-9 \-\-compress\-icons=0"; export UPX
\&    for csh/tcsh:      setenv UPX "\-9 \-\-compress\-icons=0"
.Ve
.PP
Under DOS/Windows you must use '#' instead of '=' when setting the
environment variable because of a \s-1COMMAND.COM\s0 limitation.
.PP
Not all of the options are valid in the environment variable \-
\&\fB\s-1UPX\s0\fR will tell you.
.PP
You can explicitly use the \fB\-\-no\-env\fR option to ignore the
environment variable.

Introduction
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  Linux/386 support in UPX consists of 3 different executable formats,
\&  one optimized for ELF executables ("linux/elf386"), one optimized
\&  for shell scripts ("linux/sh386"), and one generic format
\&  ("linux/386").
\&
\&  We will start with a general discussion first, but please
\&  also read the relevant docs for each of the individual formats.
\&
\&  Also, there is special support for bootable kernels \- see the
\&  description of the vmlinuz/386 format.

General user's overview
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  Running a compressed executable program trades less space on a
\&  \`\`permanent\*(Aq\*(Aq storage medium (such as a hard disk, floppy disk,
\&  CD\-ROM, flash memory, EPROM, etc.) for more space in one or more
\&  \`\`temporary\*(Aq\*(Aq storage media (such as RAM, swap space, /tmp, etc.).
\&  Running a compressed executable also requires some additional CPU
\&  cycles to generate the compressed executable in the first place,
\&  and to decompress it at each invocation.
\&
\&  How much space is traded?  It depends on the executable, but many
\&  programs save 30% to 50% of permanent disk space.  How much CPU
\&  overhead is there?  Again, it depends on the executable, but
\&  decompression speed generally is at least many megabytes per second,
\&  and frequently is limited by the speed of the underlying disk
\&  or network I/O.
\&
\&  Depending on the statistics of usage and access, and the relative
\&  speeds of CPU, RAM, swap space, /tmp, and file system storage, then
\&  invoking and running a compressed executable can be faster than
\&  directly running the corresponding uncompressed program.
\&  The operating system might perform fewer expensive I/O operations
\&  to invoke the compressed program.  Paging to or from swap space
\&  or /tmp might be faster than paging from the general file system.
\&  \`\`Medium\-sized\*(Aq\*(Aq programs which access about 1/3 to 1/2 of their
\&  stored program bytes can do particularly well with compression.
\&  Small programs tend not to benefit as much because the absolute
\&  savings is less.  Big programs tend not to benefit proportionally
\&  because each invocation may use only a small fraction of the program,
\&  yet UPX decompresses the entire program before invoking it.
\&  But in environments where disk or flash memory storage is limited,
\&  then compression may win anyway.
\&
\&  Currently, executables compressed by UPX do not share RAM at runtime
\&  in the way that executables mapped from a file system do.  As a
\&  result, if the same program is run simultaneously by more than one
\&  process, then using the compressed version will require more RAM and/or
\&  swap space.  So, shell programs (bash, csh, etc.)  and \`\`make\*(Aq\*(Aq
\&  might not be good candidates for compression.
\&
\&  UPX recognizes three executable formats for Linux: Linux/elf386,
\&  Linux/sh386, and Linux/386.  Linux/386 is the most generic format;
\&  it accommodates any file that can be executed.  At runtime, the UPX
\&  decompression stub re\-creates in /tmp a copy of the original file,
\&  and then the copy is (re\-)executed with the same arguments.
\&  ELF binary executables prefer the Linux/elf386 format by default,
\&  because UPX decompresses them directly into RAM, uses only one

\&  \- As UPX leaves your original program untouched it is advantageous

\&
\&  \- Obviously UPX won\*(Aqt work with executables that want to read data
\&    from themselves. E.g., this might be a problem for Perl scripts
\&    which access their _\|_DATA_\|_ lines.
\&
\&  \- In case of internal errors the stub will abort with exitcode 127.

\&  For files which are not ELF and not a script for a known "\-c" shell,
\&  UPX uses kernel execve(), which first requires decompressing to a

\&  often does not introduce a noticeable delay, and in fact there
\&  will be no disk access at all if you have enough free memory as
\&  the entire process takes places within the file system buffers.
\&
\&  A compressed executable consists of the UPX stub and an overlay
\&  which contains the original program in a compressed form.
\&
\&  The UPX stub is a statically linked ELF executable and does
\&  the following at program startup:
\&
\&    1) decompress the overlay to a temporary location in /tmp
\&    2) open the temporary file for reading
\&    3) try to delete the temporary file and start (execve)
\&       the uncompressed program in /tmp using /proc/<pid>/fd/X as

The \s-1PE\s0 support in \fB\s-1UPX\s0\fR is quite stable now, but probably there are
still some incompatibilities with some files.
.PP
Because of the way \fB\s-1UPX\s0\fR (and other packers for this format) works, you
can see increased memory usage of your compressed files because the whole
program is loaded into memory at startup.
If you start several instances of huge compressed programs you're
wasting memory because the common segments of the program won't
get shared across the instances.
On the other hand if you're compressing only smaller programs, or
running only one instance of larger programs, then this penalty is
smaller, but it's still there.
.PP
If you're running executables from network, then compressed programs
will load faster, and require less bandwidth during execution.
.PP
DLLs are supported. But \s-1UPX\s0 compressed DLLs can not share common data and
code when they got used by multiple applications. So compressing msvcrt.dll
is a waste of memory, but compressing the dll plugins of a particular
application may be a better idea.

Screensavers are supported, with the restriction that the filename
must end with \*(L".scr\*(R" (as screensavers are handled slightly different
than normal exe files).

\&\s-1UPX\s0 compressed \s-1PE\s0 files have some minor memory overhead (usually in the
