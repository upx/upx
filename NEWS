    exist, all info needed by runtime loader must be first in .text, etc.)

    Universal binaries [i686 and PowerPC only]
  * dos/exe: LZMA is now also supported for 16-bit dos/exe. Please note that
    you have to explicitly use '--lzma' even for '--ultra-brute' here
    because runtime decompression is about 30 times slower than NRV -
    which is really noticeable on old machines.
