==================================================================
User visible changes for UPX
==================================================================

Changes in 2.01 (06 Jun 2006):
  * arm/pe: better DLL support
  * dos/exe: device driver support added
  * linux/386: Fix --force-execve for PaX, grSecurity, and strict SELinux.
    /tmp must support execve(); therefore /tmp cannot be mounted 'noexec'.
  * win32/pe & arm/pe: added new option '--keep-resource=' for
    excluding selected resources from compression

Changes in 2.00 (27 Apr 2006):
  * linux/386: the stub now prints an error message if some strict
    SELinux mode does prevent runtime decompression and execution
    (for a fully SELinux-compatible but otherwise inferior compression
    format you can use the '--force-execve' option)
  * linux/386: worked around a problem where certain Linux kernels
    clobber the %ebx register during a syscall
  * win32/pe: disable filters for files with broken PE headers

Changes in 1.96 beta (13 Apr 2006):

  * arm/pe: added DLL support
  * arm/pe: added thumb mode stub support

  * linux/386: added the option '--force-execve'
  * vmlinuz/386: better kernel detection and sanity checks
  * re-synced with upx 1.24 branch
  * documentation updates

Changes in 1.11 beta (20 Dec 2000):
  * vmlinuz/386: new format - UPX now supports bootable linux kernels
  * linux/elf386: added the new ELF direct-to-memory executable format - no
    more temp files are needed for decompression!
